    "**ANOVA** or *Analysis Of Variance*  provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes the $t$-test beyond two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare whether multiple groups differ in some measure. For example, we have collected mood data grouped by four types of weather - sunny, raining, overcast, or cloudy, and we want to find out whether there is a difference in mood across different weather. What tests would you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural reaction would be to conduct multiple $t$-tests. However, that comes with many drawbacks. First, you would need $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ t tests, which comes out to 6 tests. More tests means having a higher chance of making a Type I error. In this case, if our original probability of making a Type I error was $5\\%$, it would now grow to $1-(1-0.05)^6 = 26\\%$! By conducting 6 tests and comparing their means to each other, we are running a huge risk of making false positives. This is known as the **multiple comparisons problem**. How then, can we combat this? -- ANOVA!\n",
