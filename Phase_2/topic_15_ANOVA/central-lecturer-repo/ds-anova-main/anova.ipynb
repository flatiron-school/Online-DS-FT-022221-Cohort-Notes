    "**ANOVA** or *Analysis Of Variance*  provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal, and therefore generalizes the $t$-test beyond two means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to compare whether multiple groups differ in some measure. For example, we have collected mood data grouped by four types of weather - sunny, raining, overcast, or cloudy, and we want to find out whether there is a difference in mood across different weather. What tests would you use?\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural reaction would be to conduct multiple $t$-tests. However, that comes with many drawbacks. First, you would need $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ t tests, which comes out to 6 tests. More tests means having a higher chance of making a Type I error. In this case, if our original probability of making a Type I error was $5\\%$, it would now grow to $1-(1-0.05)^6 = 26\\%$! By conducting 6 tests and comparing their means to each other, we are running a huge risk of making false positives. This is known as the **multiple comparisons problem**. How then, can we combat this? -- ANOVA!\n",

    "Instead of looking at each individual difference, ANOVA examines the ratio of variance between groups, and variance within groups, to find out whether the ratio is big enough to be statistically significant. "
